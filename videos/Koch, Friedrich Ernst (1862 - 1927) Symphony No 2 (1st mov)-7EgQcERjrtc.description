Friedrich Koch was born in Berlin and studied cello with Robert Hausmann and composition with Woldemar Bargiel at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik. He served as a cellist in the Royal Orchestra of Berlin between 1882 and 1891, after which he accepted a position of music director (Kapellmeister) at Baden-Baden. 

A year later, he returned to Berlin, where he concentrated on composing and teaching, eventually becoming a professor and director of theory at the Musikhochschule where he had studied.

His Symphony No.2, Op.10 dates from 1891. It is dedicated to Hans von Bulow. I have completed a rendition of the first movement.
